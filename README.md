#Welcome to my course project!

###This is my first cryptoanaliser CryptoScan.

This app using Caesar's cipher sequence. 
You can crypt any text file.

For encryption we using three ways.
1. Standard Encryption, if you know the key.
2. BruteForce option if you don't know author, or have short message.
3. StatisticEncryptor option if you have big crypted text and know author, because for correct encription you need example text from this author.

To start app just run Relises/javarush_cryptocode.jar.
